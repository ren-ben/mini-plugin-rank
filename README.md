<b>Project Rank </b> Is A Simple Rank System Plugin

# Description🍎

This is a test plugin, meaning I don't really intend it for the public use, the "Mini Plugin" series is for me to play around in both Spigot and Github. Though, feel free to download and test my Plugins! Even if it isn't intended for public use

1. Java 17 ☕
2. Minecraft 1.18.1👀

# Installation🕹️

1. Create A Server
   
   1. Download [Spigot](https://getbukkit.org/get/bf7ac3b5bc08ea97d22919680d240a80)
   
   2. Make a new folder
   
   3. Paste and rename the Spigot file to `spigot.jar`

# Basic Premise🪄

Assign Ranks and give Permissions to Players!

You'll have 5 Ranks to choose from:

- Owner

- Admin

- Helper

- Builder

- Newcomer

Each one has it's own Color and certain functions, example a Helper can't use the kick or the ban command, but he can set the time of the day.

# Usage💡

`/role <player> <role>` is the overall Syntax for assigning Ranks

(btw you don't need to write the '<>' symbols I added them just for clarity)

You also can't assign a higher rank to yourself, and you will be a Newcomer at the beginning. You will firstly need to execute the command from the terminal.

# What I've Learned📚

I really feel like I understand .yml files alot better now. I also used the Tab Completion functionality and used Enums for the first time. This project really gave me an understanding in pushing and pulling data out of a local file. I really hope my next projects are going to be as useful as this one.

# Acknowledgements🏆

This project is actually a challenge from [This Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/develop-minecraft-plugins-java-programming/) on Udemy made by Stephen King, all credit for the initial idea goes to him, although I didn't look at the code he wrote and all the code that's located inside this plugin is my original code.
